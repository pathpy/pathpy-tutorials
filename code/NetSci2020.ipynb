    "Compared to many other packages, `pathpy` has a couple of advantages. First, it is easy to install as should have no dependencies not included in a default `anaconda` installation. Second, `pathpy` has a user-friendly API that makes it easy to handle directed and undirected networks, networks with single and multiple edges, multi-layer networks or temporal networks. It also provides interactive HTML visualisations that can be directly displayed inside `jupyter` notebooks, which makes it particularly suitable for educational settings. Third, it supports the analysis and visualisation of time series data on networked systems, such as time-stamped edges or data on paths in networks.\n",

    "\n",
    "An important question in the drawing of networks is where nodes are placed. The positioning of nodes determines whether it is easy to spot patterns in the topology of the network. As a general rule, good network visualisations should have a small number of crossing edges and nodes should be placed away from each other such that we can easily distinguish them. If we make no other effort, pathpy will automatically use a simple, interactive force-directed layout algorithm. It is based on the idea that nodes connected by an edge are moved towards each other by an attractive force, while an additional repulsive force between all node pairs makes sure that nodes are not drawn on top pf each other. The simulation of those forces, and the computation of a steady-state of the resulting many-particle system is what determines the node positions in the default pathpy visualisation. Also, this is the basis upon which nodes move if you disturb the visualisation by dragging around nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the default layout algorithm makes it simple to visualise networks, it has the disadvantage that the layout is actually calculated in JavaScript. This means that the positions of nodes are actually not stored in python, which makes it impossible to influence (or store) node positions from python. To solve this issue, `pathpy` provides a `layout` module that can be used to precompute node positions based on different layout algorithms. Moreover, it allows to manually optimise the parameters of those algorithms to generate a nice visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The styling of node positions via a layout style follows the same idea like the styling of plots via a plot style. We can store the parameters in a dictionary and pass them to the `layout` function using the ** operator. To compute ode positions based on a certain number of iterations of the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm with a specific force value we can write:"

We have seen that such higher-order models can yield better predictions compared to standard network models. However, a critical question arises: how can we decide **at which order we should model a given system**? This points to a more general problem as we can also imagine systems for which path statistics do not deviate significantly from the transitive, Markovian assumption made by a first-order model. So we **need methods to decide when higher-order models are actually required**.\n",

    "To fix the issues above, we need a probabilistic generative model that can deal with extensive collections of (short) paths in a network. The key idea is to combine multiple higher-order network models into a single multi-layered, multi-order model. To calculate the likelihood of such a model, we can use all layers, thus avoiding the problem that we discard prefixes of paths. For each path, we start the calculation at a layer of order zero, which considers the relative probabilities of nodes. We then use this model layer to calculate the probability to observe the first node on a path. For the next transition to step two, we then use a first-order model. The next transition is calculated in the second-order model and so on until we have reached the maximum order of our multi-order model. At this point, we can transitively calculate the likelihood based on the remaining transitions of the path.\n",
