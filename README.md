pathpy-tutorials
================

In this repository, you will find a collection of
[pathpy](https://github.com/pathpy/pathpy) tutorials on (Spatial)-Temporal
Network Analysis and Visualisation as well as Higher-Order Network Analytics and
Multi-Order Model Selection.

The latest [tutorial schedule](https://pathpy.github.io/pathpy-tutorials/) as well as [step-by-step setup instructions](https://pathpy.github.io/pathpy-tutorials/setup) can be found on the [tutorial website](https://pathpy.github.io/pathpy-tutorials/). If you are interested in an older tutorial, you can switch the branch based on the tutorial tag.

Obtain the tutorial material
----------------------------

While you can manually download all necessary files, we strongly recommend to clone this repository to obtain a local, sychronised copy of all material via `git`. Assuming you have a local `git` installation, you can do this as follows:

    git clone --depth 1 --branch <Tag> https://github.com/pathpy/pathpy-tutorials

The option `--depth 1` ensures that you only get the latest version, ignoring the history of the repository. Furthermore, the option `--branch <Tag>` (e.g. `--branch NetSciX-2020`) ensures that you get the right tutorials. If you don't have `git` installed already, here you can find information on [how to set up git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

Prior to the hands-on tutorial, you will get access to skeleton `python` files, that we will complete together throughout the tutorial sessions. At specific *synchronisation points, we will push a commit of the current solution to this `gitHub` repository. You can thus simply execute the terminal command

`git pull`

in the directory of your local copy to receive a *sample solution* that is growing as the tutorial advances.

Educational resources
---------------------

Our team is comitted to assist users in leveraging the power of Higher-Order Network Analytics. We regularly offer talks, lectures, demonstrations, and tutorials that introduce Higher-Order Network Analytics with [pathpy](https://github.com/pathpy/pathpy). Below we collect information on those events, which often include publicly available educational material and video recordings.

Are you interest in hosting a lecture or tutorial on pathpy in your institution? Or are you using pathpy to teach (higher-order** network analytics? We would be excited to hear from you!
